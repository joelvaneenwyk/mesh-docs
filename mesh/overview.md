# Microsoft Mesh overview

To support a truly flexible workplace, organizations and employees need technology that helps them feel connected regardless of where they work. Over the years, we have learned that a thriving workplace fosters authentic human connections—allowing employees and teams to build meaningful relationships and trust so they can perform at their highest potential.

According to Microsoft’s Work Trend Index report, 43 percent of leaders say relationship building is the [greatest challenge in remote and hybrid work](https://www.microsoft.com/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work-is-just-work). Coming together in a physical space helps, but it’s not always possible—travel costs are prohibitive, real estate is expensive, and talent is increasingly dispersed. We need new ways for people to connect from different locations or geographies, using the tools they already have.

## Introducing Microsoft Mesh

We are re-imagining the way employees come together with Microsoft Mesh, a new three-dimensional (3D) immersive experience.

Microsoft Mesh is not merely another innovation, but a solution that enables your distributed workforce to connect like never before in a 3D immersive space, helping virtual meetings and events feel more like face-to-face connections.

Here’s what makes Mesh a powerful tool to bring your organization together:

### 3D digital environments—meaningful connections in shared spaces  

Immersive spaces have unique attributes that create a perception of being physically together in a 3D digital space, including spatial interaction, co-presence, and immersion. Digital engagement is evolving from audio to video, and now to **spatial interaction**.

Spatial awareness through directionality and distance enables multiple small group discussions in the same place, adding familiar human elements to digital connections. Spending time in the same 3D environment also creates a powerful sense of togetherness, or **co-presence**, even without actively speaking.

This co-presence can lead to serendipitous moments of conversation or even just the deepened connection of a shared experience. 3D environments also remove distractions and help participants focus on fewer things—specifically the people and objects that surround them, driving a higher sense of **immersion**.

## Immersive spaces in Microsoft or Mesh

When to use immersive spaces in Teams or use the Mesh application.

## Use immersive spaces in Microsoft Teams

Use [immersive spaces in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/4a6182f8-0f43-4c24-bb66-ef229fa221d8#ID0EBH=Microsoft_Teams) to bring the power of Mesh into Microsoft Teams. Getting started is easy! From the View menu in a Teams meeting, you select the immersive space option. With just a click, you will transform your two-dimensional (2D) meeting into a 3D immersive experience.
