# Mesh Development Overview

Your custom Mesh experience starts out in Unity as a new project or existing sample. You can add content to the project/sample *Scene* and then upload it to a world in Mesh on the web as an *Environment*. An *organizer* can then create a Mesh event based on your Environment.

In this section, you'll find articles that introduce you to the features of Mesh Toolkit, walk you through Unity setup, and describe the samples provided by Microsoft that you can use as a starting point for your Environment.

## Develop in Unity with Mesh Toolkit

The Mesh Toolkit for Unity provides a collection of features that enable you to develop rich interactive worlds.

**The Mesh Toolkit includes:**

* [Mesh graphics tools](design/overview.md), a collection of scripts, shaders, assets, and samples created to help improve the visual fidelity of Mesh worlds while staying within performance budgets.

* [Mesh physics](enhance-your-environment/physics/mesh-physics-overview.md), used to create enabling and engaging dynamic content.

* [Mesh interactables](enhance-your-environment/avatar-and-object-interactions/interactables.md), allowing participants to grab, hold, throw, select, anchor, tether and spawn

* [Mesh controllables](enhance-your-environment/multi-room-sync.md), enabling event hosts to control and sync video and timeline playback across multiple rooms of a large event.

* [Mesh WebSlates](enhance-your-environment/webcontent.md), enabling designers to add a panel that displays a given web page.

* [Mesh visual scripting](script-your-scene-logic/visual-scripting/visual-scripting-overview.md), which lets you add interactivity and dynamic runtime behavior to your Mesh Environments by creating script graphs instead of writing code.

* [Mesh cloud scripting](script-your-scene-logic/cloud-scripting/cloud-scripting-basic-concepts.md), which lets you connect to real-time backend data and call .NET APIs via cloud-hosted server scripts.

* [Mesh Play mode](debug-and-optimize-performance/mesh-emulator.md), which lets you press Play in a Mesh content project to preview how your content will look like running in Mesh for multiple users.

* [Mesh Uploader](make-your-environment-available/build-and-publish-your-environment.md), which lets you upload the Environments you create to Mesh on the web.

* [Mesh Content Performance Analyzer](debug-and-optimize-performance/cpa.md) (CPA): automatically reports content optimization issues and opportunities before content is uploaded to Mesh on the web.

The Mesh Toolkit is free to download; however, a Teams Premium license is required for all users (including developers and technical 3D artists) to use Microsoft Mesh.
