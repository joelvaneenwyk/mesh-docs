# Create an event in Mesh on the web

Use Mesh on the web to create and manage events, Mesh collections, and custom environments. Once events are made, Mesh events show up in your Outlook or Teams calendar with a direct link that people can use to join events, making inviting and joining events quicker.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that all participants have updated their Mesh app to the most recent version to ensure that they can use the link in their calendar invite and join the event you just created!

## Events vs Templates

With Mesh, you can create one-time Events or Templates that can be reused as needed. Create a Template, customize it once, and reuse it again and again.

For example, when you create an event in Mesh on the web you can choose the **Use an Event template** option:

If you want to create a template, customize it, and reuse it, see [Create event template](create-template.md).

Read on to learn how to create a single event.

## Considerations before your event

Consider the following time and capacity constraints when creating your Mesh event or Template.

### Time constraints for Mesh events

- Single room events (16 people max): 24-hour time limit.

- Multi-room events (200 people max): 3-hour time limit.

### Event capacity

- 200 attendees per event
- 16 attendees per room
- Up to 16 hosts in a separate room, additional to the 200 attendees

> [!NOTE]
> Only three event hosts can broadcast at the same time.

### Customize **before** your event

To ensure the event runs smoothly, customize and save the customizations at least 30 minutes before the event start time.

## Create an event

1. Open Mesh on the web at [https://portal.mesh.microsoft.com/](https://portal.mesh.microsoft.com/) or [https://mesh.cloud.microsoft/](https://mesh.cloud.microsoft/).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Mesh on the web is moving to cloud.microsoft [with all Microsoft 365 apps and services](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/introducing-cloud-microsoft-a-unified-domain-for-microsoft-365/ba-p/3804961). To help ease this transition, we are providing two links for Mesh on the web. To use the new cloud.microsoft endpoint, ensure you have allowed the proper endpoints allowed, as detailed in the [Preparing your organization article](../Setup/Content/preparing-your-organization.md#ensure-endpoints-can-be-allowed-for-immersive-spaces-in-teams).
    >
    > If you have any issues with the new Mesh on the web experience, you can continue to use *portal.mesh.microsoft.com*.

1. Log in with your corporate account.

1. In the Home page, select **Events** in the left navigation bar.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Once your event is created, you cannot change the environment, the template, room configuration, room capacity, or Max Participants.

    Learn more about [creating Templates](create-template.md).

1. Add your Co-organizers (who will be able to edit the event) and your Attendees (who will be able to join the event) and select **Create event** when finished.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/events-guide-create-event/Mesh-on-web-invite-coorganizer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Mesh on the Web showing invite co-organizer page for an event.":::

Great job! You've now created your event. Co-organizers and invitees will now see the event in their Outlook and Teams calendars.

Co-organizers can also invite people in Outlook and forward the invite to people as desired.

## Create Templates from your event

Once your event is created, you have the option to save it as an Template to be reused in the future.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you save an event as a Template, any future customizations in the app won't make it into the saved template. In order to edit the Template, you need to customize it directly.
